# AskReddit Q&A Chatbot

This project is part of the course Speech Technology DT2112 (KTH).

This project aims at building a chatbot based on the data collected from the AskReddit subreddit. The idea is to train a generative seq-2-seq sentence-level model implemented in Keras to learn how to answer arbitrary questions, based on the top answers and posts found in the selected subreddit.
